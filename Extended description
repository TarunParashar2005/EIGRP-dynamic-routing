EIGRP-dynamic-routing:-

Objectives:
- Configure EIGRP AS 100 between a central router and two edge routers. Validate DUAL operation and reachability across the 172.16 and 192.168 sites.

Topology:
- Connect center router R3 to the left and right ISR edges over the 10.0.0.0/30 and 20.0.0.0/30 networks. 
- Use a center switch for the 172.16.0.0/24 LAN. The edges will host 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24.

Devices: 3 routers, 2 2960 switches, 6 PCs.

Steps:
- - router eigrp 100; no auto-summary; network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3; network 20.0.0.0 0.0.0.3; network 172.16.0.0 0.0.0.255; network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255; network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255; passive LANs.
- - Optional: Use authentication with key chains. Adjust bandwidth and delay for metric demonstrations.

Verify:
- show ip eigrp neighbors; show ip eigrp topology; show ip route eigrp; ping hosts across the sites.

Troubleshooting:
- K-value mismatches or network statements that omit an interface can prevent adjacency. Ensure you have a common AS number.

Expected outcome:
- Stable neighbors, feasible successors where applicable, and successful end-to-end connectivity.
